# Daily-planner

This application is a calendar that lets the user save event information for each hour of the workday. The top of the page displays the current date.
As time passes the color of the rows will change to indicate to the user that the event they have entered has passed (shown as red), is current (shown as white) or is upcoming (shown as green). Local storage is used so that when an event is saved it is stored locally and is displayed on load. Events that are entered can be changed or removed by changing or deleting the text and clicking the save button. This app is intended to help orgainze the day and keep track of events.
